The malaria dataset we will be using in todayâ€™s deep learning and medical image analysis tutorial is the exact same dataset that Rajaraman et al. used in their 2018 publication.

The dataset itself can be found on the official NIH webpage:

The dataset consists of 27,588 images belonging to two separate classes:

Parasitized: Implying that the region contains malaria.
Uninfected: Meaning there is no evidence of malaria in the region.
The number of images per class is equally distributed with 13,794 images per each respective class.
